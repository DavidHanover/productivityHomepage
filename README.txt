This is meant to be a productivity homepage for when I open up my web-browser every day.

My intention is to host it on github pages.

It will be a simple text page with some simple styling so it doesn't look awful.

It will randomly pick a single leetcode problem from the blind-curated 75 list, and display the link.

It will link to the hackernews who is hiring thread from the current month.

It will also link to the linkedin jobs page with my preferred search criteria.  

So far, that's all I will be adding, but I may update this project if I change my career goals or think of aditional improvements.

edit: Might also link to my random music-making inspiration page.
